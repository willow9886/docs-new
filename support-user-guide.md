# Gluu Support User Guide
The [Gluu Support portal](https://support.gluu.org) provides a place where both Gluu customers and the community can get answers for questions about Gluu Server operations, customizations, integrations and more. 

Supported Gluu Customers, known as "Named Contacts", can open private tickets, set ticket priorities, upload files, collaborate with team members and partner organizations on private tickets, and more. If you are currently a community user and would like to become a supported customer, please review our [support pricing](http://gluu.org/pricing) and then [schedule a meeting](http://gluu.org/booking).

1. Community Users: Any user without a paid Gluu support contract.
