# Gluu Support User Guide
The [Gluu Support portal](https://support.gluu.org) provides a place where both Gluu customers and the community can get answerws for questions about Gluu Server operations, customizations, integrations and more. 

Supported Gluu Customers, known as "Named Contacts", can open private tickets, set ticket priorities, upload files, collaborate with team members and partners on private tickets, and more. If you are currently a community user and would like to become a supported customer, please review our [support pricing](http://gluu.org/pricing) and then [schedule a meeting](http://gluu.org/booking). 

# Roles
There are four different types on users on Gluu Support:   

1. Community Users: Any user without a paid Gluu support contract.     

2. Named Users: Users associated with an organization that has paid for a Gluu support contract.     

3. Partners: Gluu service partners that have been engaged by a Gluu customer to assist with operations, integrations, customizations, etc.  

4. Staff: Gluu staff users.   

# Homepage
The homepage of the Support Portal groups all public tickets into categories such as integrations, installation, maintenance, etc. On each ticket listing you can see who the ticket was opened by, whether the ticket is open or closed, and how many responses the issue has generated. If you are a supported customer, the homepage will also include private tickets created by you or one of your organizational colleagues.  

# Registration
Registration is fairly straightforward. One thing to note is that if you are associated with a supported organization, please use your organizational email address during registration. This will ensure that after registration you have elevated privileges such as access to your company's private tickets. 

# Login 
The Gluu Support Portal utilizes our own internal Gluu Server for login. If you have any trouble logging in, please send an email to [support@gluu.org](mailto:support@gluu.org)

# Front-End Search
Using the front-end search located on the homepage, you can find and review any existing public tickets that may be related to the issue or question you are seeking answers to. 

Searches can be performed against all tickets in the database, or you can select a specific category to search within. 

# Opening Tickets
After successfuly registering an account you can open tickets on Gluu Support. Community users have a slightly reduced set of options for opening tickets.
