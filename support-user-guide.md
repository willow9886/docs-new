# Gluu Support User Guide
The [Gluu Support portal](https://support.gluu.org) provides a place where both Gluu customers and the community can get answerws for questions about Gluu Server operations, customizations, integrations and more. 

Supported Gluu Customers, known as "Named Contacts", can open private tickets, set ticket priorities, upload files, collaborate with team members and partners on private tickets, and more. If you are currently a community user and would like to become a supported customer, please review our [support pricing](http://gluu.org/pricing) and then [schedule a meeting](http://gluu.org/booking). 

# Roles

# Homepage
The homepage of the Gluu Support Portal groups tickets into categories such as integrations, installation, maintenance, etc. On each ticket listing you can see who the ticket was opened by, whether the ticket is open or closed, and how many responses the issue has generated. The tickets that are displayed depend on your user role. If you are a supported customer or partner, the homepage will include private tickets created by you or one of your organizational colleagues.
